      - [x] There should be visual feedback (such as the heart turning a different color) to show that the playlist has been unliked by the user.

      - [x] a playlist with a like count of 0

### Walkthrough Video

`TODO://` Add the embedded URL code to your animated app walkthrough below, `ADD_EMBEDDED_CODE_HERE`. Make sure the video actually renders and is playable when viewing this README. Ensure your walkthrough showcases the presence and/or functionality of all features you implemented above (check them off as you film!). Pay attention to any **VIDEO WALKTHROUGH SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS** checkboxes listed above to ensure graders see the full functionality of your website!

### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

    Yes, the topics in the lab helped me get familiar with Javascript and allowed me to utilize it to make my site functional. The labs I completed over the weekend on my own time, so I had time to do the project within the period we are given during the day.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
  If I had more time, I would implement the edit, add, and delete features which would update the playlists displayed on the code. This would not take that long as I already have the code modular within functions, but it would be a great addition.


* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

The project demo went well, I presented all that I'd like to. Within the next demo, I need to present slower and show every feature on the page. Overall, it went really well.

### Open-source libraries used

### Shout out

Shout out to Devarsh for the lectures, they really helped me understand how to dynamically display data with JS.
